G = {V, E}. - graph is a collection of vertiges(single value) and edges(connection between two nodes)

Oriented and Neoriented graphs

Directed  A -----> B one direction
Undirected A<----->B goes both ways
Wheighted graph - edges have meaning. ----> 3000km


Graphs are used for searching the shortest way from one point to another;


How to represent a graph??

1. Adjacency matrix 

2. Adjancency list - each item has its own array of its neighbors. Its faster and more efficient with memory.
    A. B C
    B. A 
    C. A D
    D. C

Reachable problem - which nodes can i reach from source node





dfs - depth first search
Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

So the basic idea is to start from the root or any arbitrary node and mark the node and move to the adjacent unmarked node and continue this loop until there is no unmarked adjacent node. Then backtrack and check for other unmarked nodes and traverse them. Finally, print the nodes in the path.
